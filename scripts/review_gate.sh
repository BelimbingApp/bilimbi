# Decide whether a pull request has an independent, exact-head acceptance.
#
# This is the package's single review grammar. `gate.sh` uses it as its
# pre-flight review step; the GitHub Actions workflow uses it as the required
# CI check. Keeping those two callers behind this file prevents a valid review
# in one place from being invisible in the other.
#
#   scripts/review_gate.sh <pr-number> [<reviewed-full-sha>]
#   REVIEW_GATE_INPUT=<fixture.json> scripts/review_gate.sh
#
# Fixture input has `reviewed`, `labels`, and `reviews` fields. `labels` may be
# an array of label names or GitHub label objects; `reviews` uses the API shape.
# Exit 0 means an independent acceptance exists and no independent
# changes-required verdict supersedes it. Exit 1 is a review failure; exit 2 is
# an invocation or GitHub-read failure.
